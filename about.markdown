This is my personal blog where I plan to (primarily) talk about
software engineering and technical interviewing.

I've worked on a hardware/software/language co-design research project (at BAE Systems);
ingestion, storage, and analytics for Alexa's machine learning data platform
(at Amazon); infrastructure for news, and analytics for Android (at Google);
and most recently a smattering of engineering, product, and culture for
a growing office (at Smartsheet). You can find more about what I've done
on my [resume](https://joshmcgrath08.github.io/resume/resume.html).

Since being introduced to software engineering in college, I've enjoyed that
it allows me to build things with very few constraints. At the same time, I
believe it is fairly distinct from most other engineering disciplines. In the
spirit of [Worse is Better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better), most
modern and effective approaches to software engineering focus on finding working solutions
quickly through iterative approaches rather than trying to build working solutions from
first principles.

And while it's easy to just focus on the coding and technical aspects of software
engineering, at it's heart it's a collaborative, human effort. For this reason,
and from seeing the effects of interviewing done well and poorly, respectively,
I've come to care deeply about and invest a lot of time in thinking about and
practicing interviewing skills.
